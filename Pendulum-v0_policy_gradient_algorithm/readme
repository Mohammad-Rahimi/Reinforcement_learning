In this code, I will implement vanilla policy gradient algorithm (REINFORCE) covered in the lecture. You will work on i) a function approximator, ii) computing action, iii) collecting samples, iV) training the agent, V) plotting the resutls.
some upgrades added implementing Reinforce and actor-critic algorithm from scratch
advanced PPO compared with them
